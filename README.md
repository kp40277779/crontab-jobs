# crontab-jobs
This script makes it easy for a some one new to unix, to create crontab jobs

The idea of this program was to enable the entry of crontab jobs to users with a
lesser technical experience by providing a more friendly user interface and
automating the construction of the crontab file. This was done by taking user input
from the command line and collating said information through a script. We made use
of many primary linux functions to manipulate files and directory structures.
